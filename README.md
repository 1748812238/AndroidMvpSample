# AndroidMvpSample
This prject is useed demonstrate how to user MVP architecture in Android developmentã€‚

I show two implementations version,the enhance version used to solve potential memory leak problem.
If you not allow user cancle a operation before it finished(eg: call a remote server and wait until the result back)
the first version is qualified,but i recommend you use the enhance version.
